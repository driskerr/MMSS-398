# MMSS-398
This is me trying to put something together for my senior thesis. YAY ACADEMIA!

# Synopsis

So. This project uses the Add Health Survey and is looking specifically at the AIAN subpopulation. More specifically, I am interested in seeing if the distinction between self-identified race and external-percieved race (as measured by the interviewer's categorization of race) manifest itself in other characteristics. My question is: How does having others misperceive racial identity associate with the deviant behavior, integration into social networks, and mental health, particularly among teens who self-identify as AIAN? I currently only dealing with Wave I of the Add Health Survey conducted in the 1994-95 school year. Exploration into Wave III may happen further down the line.

# Motivation

This project was created because I need to do something to complete my degree. I am a little wary about exploring such a complicated and sensitive subject as race as a white person, I hope I find truth in the data. Anywho, this work was largely inspired by Saperstein's work and observations from my peers at school that deal with racial passing/ambiguity, and its about challenging the social scientific assumption that race is only self-created to show that external society is also essential in the construction of race. As one half-black, half-Thai student mentioned in class the other day, "I don't know what it's like to be Asian because I am not percieved that way. I am always seen as black first. But, when you get technical about it [refering to her private experience/heritage/culture], I am more Asian..." Seems like a complex question, no?

# Installation

I am doing this in Stata. I have to use the large-heavy-duty-kind (beyond 2,048 variables) that is available in the MMSS lounge.

# Contributors

This code was created by me, Kerry Driscoll, with the oversight of my advisor Prof. Christine Percheski. I am sure there are many other people I will need to thank down the line (Darryl Wood, etc), but I'll get to that later. In the meantime, if anyone knows of any other data sets that use both self- and external- identifiers of race. Let a girl know. 

# License

I am an undergraduate student. Please don't dick me over. I doubt anyone will come across this, but if you do, please respect whatever value my work may have. Please and thank you.
